For PDG Invent Hackathon 2019 a group of us are working on ways to enable anyone (technical or non-technical) to contribute directly to documentation.

If you are willing to give up a few minutes of your time, please follow the [steps at this link](https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Docs4all+Hackathon+2019+user+testing#Docs4allHackathon2019usertesting-Option1-TesttheEditonGithubworkflow).



Some of you will also receive invites shortly from netlify.com inviting you to create a user on http://hopeful-jennings-7da6b5.netlify.com. 

If you get this invite please follow the steps for 

https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Docs4all+Hackathon+2019+user+testing#Docs4allHackathon2019usertesting-Option2-TesttheNetlifyCMSworkflow(Inviteonly) .

Please don’t forget to complete the NPS survey at the end of each workflow! We’ll take a snapshot of NPS from the surveys at 8 am Dublin time on Friday 17th May, but you can continue to try out the flows after this time.

Thanks in advance for your help!
